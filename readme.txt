Graphics Assignment 2 - Top Shooter: A Game of Lattu

The physics of this game was already pretty complex. Refer http://beej.us/guide/bgnet/output/html/singlepage/bgnet.html
So, I haven't considered phyical phenomenon like gravity for the sake of simplicity.

Controls:
R - target location is randomly replaced
A and D - enable camera panning
W - Top View
S - Bottom View
Up and Down Keys - Power Adjustment
Z and X - Alter aiming angle
Space - strike initiation
